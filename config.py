AccessAI - Central configuration (the single source of truth).

Every tunable value and feature flag for the whole project lives here.
Later phases only FLIP flags and adjust values in this file; they never
scatter configuration across modules.

ESP32-CAM one-line swap
-----------------------
Right now CAMERA_SOURCE is `0` (your laptop's built-in webcam). When you later
wire up an ESP32-CAM, you change EXACTLY ONE LINE:

    CAMERA_SOURCE = "http://192.168.1.50:81/stream"

OpenCV's VideoCapture accepts an integer index OR an MJPEG URL string, so the
rest of the codebase does not change at all. That is the whole point of routing
every frame through accessai/camera.py.

Target environment: Python 3.12, Linux, CPU-only.

# same language / failure => the original transcript is used unchanged.
#
# USER_LANGUAGE (defined in the Accessibility section above) is the target code.
#
# Backend priority (all behind the SAME TranslateModule interface):
#   "github" -> PREFERRED, torch-safe. Reuses the Phase-6 GitHub Models keys +

# For every UNKNOWN, non-spoof visitor we compute an APPEARANCE embedding from

# The final phase makes the doorbell hands-free for a blind user. Two paths,
# both reuse the SAME building blocks (Phase-7 SpeechModule to capture, Phase-4
# TTS to answer, the pipeline/db for facts) - they never duplicate them:
#
#   PUSH-TO-TALK  (always available)  -> POST /listen records one command, parses
#                 it, acts, and speaks the answer. The dashboard "Speak a command"
#                 button hits this. Works even if openWakeWord is not installed.
#
#   ALWAYS-ON     (OPT-IN, default OFF) -> WakeWordModule keeps the mic open and
#                 listens for WAKEWORD_MODEL. On a detection it runs the SAME
#                 /listen interaction automatically. It is off by default on
#                 purpose: an always-open mic costs CPU and is a privacy choice
#                 the user must make deliberately (toggle in the dashboard, or set
#                 WAKEWORD_ALWAYS_ON = True here).
#
# Detector: openWakeWord (pure-python, onnxruntime, CPU). It ships pretrained
# models (hey_jarvis, alexa, hey_mycroft) that auto-download on first use. A
# custom "Hey Access" model needs training data we don't have yet, so we ship a
# pretrained model as a PLACEHOLDER wake phrase (surfaced in /status + README).
# If openWakeWord can't be imported, always-on degrades to unavailable and
# push-to-talk still works - the app never crashes.

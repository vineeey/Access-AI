"""
Pipeline - the one place that turns a camera frame into a Visitor Event.

Each phase adds a step here, but the SHAPE never changes: take a frame, fill in
a VisitorEvent, save a snapshot, persist it, return it. Modules are injected via
the constructor (all optional, default None) so later phases wire in AI without
touching call sites.

Phase 1 does NO AI: it just creates an event, writes "Someone is at the door.",
saves a snapshot, and stores it.

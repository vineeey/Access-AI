AccessibilityEngine - the OUTPUT layer (Phase 4).

This is now the single place that:
  1. COMPOSES the final announcement sentence from a VisitorEvent, and
  2. ROUTES it to the right channel based on the accessibility mode:
       - "blind" -> speak it (TTS)
       - "deaf"  -> visual only (big text + flash + vibrate, done in the browser)
       - "both"  -> speak AND visual

It supersedes context_engine.compose_interim_announcement(), which now survives
only as the fallback used when no AccessibilityEngine is injected (e.g. unit
tests, or ENABLE_TTS wiring absent).

Language stays CONSERVATIVE across every phase: "likely", "appears to be",
never "definitely". Most branches below read fields that later phases fill
(spoof P5, reid P9, ocr/scene P6, speech P7/P8); they are inert until then, so
this function is written once and simply lights up as those phases land.

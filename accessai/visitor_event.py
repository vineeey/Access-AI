"""
The Visitor Event - the single data object that flows through the whole system.

This is the SPINE of AccessAI. Every AI module (present and future) WRITES into
this object; every output (voice, notification, history) READS from it.

Design rule for all 10 phases
-----------------------------
Adding a new AI capability = fill in a field that already exists here, and have
exactly one module responsible for it. You never restructure the pipeline to add
a feature. That is why this dataclass is defined in Phase 1 with fields reserved
for ALL later phases, even though Phase 1 leaves almost all of them at their
defaults.

Field -> phase that fills it:
    identity / face_box         -> Phase 2 (face recognition)
    visitor_count / objects     -> Phase 3 (object detection)
    carried_objects / intent    -> Phase 3 (context engine)
    announcement_text           -> Phase 4 (accessibility output)
    spoof_score / is_spoof      -> Phase 5 (anti-spoofing)
    scene_summary / ocr_text    -> Phase 6 (VLM + OCR)
    speech_transcript / language -> Phase 7 (speech recognition)
    translated_transcript       -> Phase 8 (translation)
    reid_id / reid_seen_count   -> Phase 9 (re-ID + auto-enroll)
    age / gender                -> Phase 12 (InsightFace genderage, approximate)
    appearance                  -> Phase 12 (VLM clothing/uniform, unknown only)

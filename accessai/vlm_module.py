VLMModule - cloud Vision-Language scene description + OCR (Phase 6).

Sends a single doorbell frame to a GitHub Models OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions endpoint (vision) and gets back, in ONE call:

    * a short, conservative scene sentence  -> ev.scene_summary
    * any visible text / parcel-label text  -> ev.ocr_text

Why cloud (for now): the target dev laptop is 8 GB / CPU-only, and a good local
VLM won't fit. GitHub Models gives a free, OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint. A
heavy LOCAL VLM can be dropped in later behind this exact interface (available()
+ describe_and_read()) without touching the pipeline.

Design rules honoured here (same as every AccessAI module):
  * NEVER raise from __init__ - a missing `requests`, missing keys, or a dead
    network degrades to available()==False and empty results. The pipeline then
    simply runs on YOLO-only signals.
  * Multiple API keys with automatic FAILOVER (429 rate-limit / 401 / 403 /
    network error -> try the next key). Remembers the last good key.
  * NEVER log a full key. Keys are masked to their last 4 chars everywhere.
  * Language stays CONSERVATIVE: the prompt tells the model to say "appears to
    be" / "likely" and to never guess a person's identity.

# eyes" and told exactly WHICH observations matter at a front door — the
# Who / Where / What-doing / What-carrying / How-interacting questions — so the
# scene sentence carries real situational meaning ("appears to be a delivery:
# holding a box with an Amazon label, wearing a courier uniform") instead of a
# flat caption ("a person is standing outside"). The JSON SHAPE is unchanged so
# the pipeline parser keeps working; only the content got smarter.

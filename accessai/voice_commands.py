Voice commands - hands-free Blind Mode (Phase 10).

Two clean halves, deliberately split so the logic stays unit-testable:

  parse_command(text)  -> PURE. Maps a transcript to an intent + args. No I/O,
                          no config import, no globals. This is what the pytest
                          suite exercises; it never touches a camera, a mic, the
                          DB, or the TTS engine.

  handle_command(...)  -> the ONLY place with side effects. Given an intent it
                          reads the latest frame / DB and returns the SPOKEN
                          answer string. It reuses the SAME pipeline, database
                          and accessibility engine the doorbell already uses - it
                          never duplicates perception or announcement logic.

  run_voice_interaction(...) -> the glue used by BOTH entry points (the /listen
                          push-to-talk route AND the always-on wake callback):
                          capture -> transcribe (Phase-7 SpeechModule) -> parse
                          -> handle -> speak (Phase-4 TTS). Returns a small dict
                          describing what happened, for the dashboard + logs.

Design rule (same as every phase): degrade, never crash. An empty transcript,
a missing frame, or a None module all resolve to a polite spoken sentence.

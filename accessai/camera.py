"""
Camera abstraction - the ONLY place in AccessAI that opens a camera.

Why this exists
---------------
OpenCV's cv2.VideoCapture accepts either:
  * an integer index   -> a local webcam (0 = built-in, 1/2 = USB cams), OR
  * a URL string       -> a network MJPEG stream (e.g. an ESP32-CAM).

Because both go through this one class, moving from your laptop webcam to an
ESP32-CAM later is a ONE-LINE change in config.py (CAMERA_SOURCE) - nothing in
the rest of the codebase changes. Never call cv2.VideoCapture anywhere else.
